	<!--you can use media (minimum width of another view screen) and (maximum width of this new view screen)..so this can be phone size...i set it to be:when the screen is 480px below, i changed the 50% from style.css to 100% here, so that the box expands to fit the screen-- ohh also, when you view it in browser, you can drag your window to smaller portion to see the change/difference ;D-->

	
<div class="box-one">box 1</div>
<div class="box-two">box 2</div>
<div class="box-three">box 3</div>
